### **What is RStudio?**

While R is the *language* and the *engine*, RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a user-friendly interface for working with R. Think of it as a control center that makes writing, executing, and debugging R code much easier and more efficient. While you can use R without RStudio, it's highly recommended for a smoother and more productive workflow.

**Key Features of RStudio:**

* **Console:** Where R commands are executed and output is displayed.
* **Source Editor:** For writing and saving R scripts, R Markdown documents, and other files.
* **Environment Pane:** Shows all objects (variables, data frames, functions) currently loaded in your R session.
* **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer Panes:**
  * **Files:** Navigates your file system.
  * **Plots:** Displays generated graphics.
  * **Packages:** Manages installed and loaded R packages.
  * **Help:** Accesses R's documentation and package help files.
  * **Viewer:** Displays local web content, often used for interactive plots or Shiny apps.
* **Project Management:** Helps organize your work into self-contained projects, ensuring reproducibility.
* **Debugging Tools:** Features that help you identify and fix errors in your code.

#### **RStudio Interface Tour: A First Look**

Once R and RStudio are installed, open RStudio. You'll typically see a layout divided into four main panes (though you can customize this).

Let's briefly tour the default layout:

1. **Top-Left Pane: Source Editor (or Script Editor)**
    * This is where you write your R code. You'll save these as `.R` files.
    * You can execute lines of code from here by placing your cursor on the line and pressing `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Enter` (macOS).
    * You can also execute an entire script by selecting all lines and pressing `Ctrl + Enter`/`Cmd + Enter`, or by clicking the "Run" button in the toolbar.

2. **Bottom-Left Pane: Console**
    * This is where R commands are executed directly and their results are displayed.
    * You can type commands directly into the console prompt (`>`) and press `Enter` to execute them.
    * Output from scripts run from the Source Editor will also appear here.

3. **Top-Right Pane: Environment / History / Connections / Tutorial**
    * **Environment:** This tab displays all the objects (variables, data frames, functions) you have created or loaded in your current R session. It's very useful for keeping track of your data.
    * **History:** Shows a record of all the commands you've executed in the console.
    * **Connections:** Used for connecting to various data sources like databases.
    * **Tutorial:** If you have learnedr packages installed, you can access interactive tutorials here.

4. **Bottom-Right Pane: Files / Plots / Packages / Help / Viewer**
    * **Files:** A file browser that allows you to navigate your directories, open files, and create new ones.
    * **Plots:** Where all your generated R graphics (charts, plots) will appear. You can export or zoom into them here.
    * **Packages:** Lists all installed R packages. You can install new packages, update existing ones, and load/unload them from here.
    * **Help:** Provides access to R's extensive documentation. You can search for function help, package documentation, and more.
    * **Viewer:** Displays local web content, often used for interactive visualizations created with packages like `plotly` or for local Shiny applications.

#### **Basic R as a Calculator**

Let's start by using R for simple arithmetic operations directly in the **Console**. This is the simplest way to interact with R.

**Let me Introduce Comments First**
Comments are like helping text in your R program and they are ignored by the interpreter while executing your actual program. Single comment is written using # in the beginning of the statement as follows −

```r
# This is a Comment
print("Wont be printed Out")
```
R does not support multi-line comments but you can perform a trick which is something as follows −

```r
if(FALSE) {
   "This is a demo for multi-line comments and it should be put inside either a 
      single OR double quote"
}

myString <- "Hello, World!"
print ( myString)
```

**Code Snippets (R Console):**

```R
# Addition
2 + 3

# Subtraction
10 - 4

# Multiplication
5 * 6

# Division
12 / 3

# Exponentiation (power)
2^4
5**2 # Alternative for exponentiation

# Modulus (remainder after division)
10 %% 3

# Integer Division (quotient, discards remainder)
10 %/% 3
```

**Output:**

```bash
> 2 + 3
[1] 5
> 10 - 4
[1] 6
> 5 * 6
[1] 30
> 12 / 3
[1] 4
> 2^4
[1] 16
> 5**2
[1] 25
> 10 %% 3
[1] 1
> 10 %/% 3
[1] 3
```

**Key Points:**

* The `>` symbol in the console indicates that R is ready for a command.
* `[1]` before the output indicates that it's the first element of a vector. You'll learn more about vectors in the next module.
* Lines starting with `#` are **comments** and are ignored by R. Use them to explain your code!

## **Creating and Running R Scripts**

While typing directly in the console is fine for quick calculations, for any serious work, you'll want to write your code in an R Script (`.R` file). This allows you to save your work, run multiple lines of code together, and keep your analysis organized and reproducible.

**Steps:**

1. **Open a New R Script:**
    * In RStudio, go to `File > New File > R Script`.
    * This will open a blank Source Editor pane (usually top-left).

2. **Write Your Code:**
    * Type or paste the following R code into the new script:

    

    ```R
    # This is my first R script!

    # Calculate the area of a rectangle
    length <- 15
    width <- 7
    area <- length * width
    print(area)

    # Calculate the circumference of a circle
    radius <- 5
    pi_value <- 3.14159
    circumference <- 2 * pi_value * radius
    print(circumference)
    ```

    * **Note on `<-`:** This is the most common assignment operator in R (reads as "gets"). It assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left. You can also use `=`, but `<-` is generally preferred for assignment.
    * **Note on `print()`:** The `print()` function explicitly displays the value of a variable or result. In the console, R automatically prints the last unassigned expression, but in scripts, `print()` ensures output.

3. **Save the Script:**
    * Go to `File > Save As...`
    * Choose a location and name it something descriptive, like `my_first_script.R`. Make sure it ends with `.R`.

4. **Run the Script:**
    * **Run line by line:** Place your cursor on a line and press `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Enter` (macOS). The line will be sent to the console and executed.
    * **Run selected lines:** Highlight a block of code and press `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Enter` (macOS).
    * **Run entire script:** Click the "Run" button in the Source Editor toolbar (it looks like a small green arrow) or press `Ctrl + Shift + S` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd + Shift + S` (macOS) to "Source" the file.

**Expected Output in the Console:**

```bash
> # This is my first R script!
>
> # Calculate the area of a rectangle
> length <- 15
> width <- 7
> area <- length * width
> print(area)
[1] 105
>
> # Calculate the circumference of a circle
> radius <- 5
> pi_value <- 3.14159
> circumference <- 2 * pi_value * radius
> print(circumference)
[1] 31.4159
```
